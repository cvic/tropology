# CHANGELOG


## 0.2.0 (WIP)

* All codes are now lowercase. This invalidates the sample database from 20150411.
* Individual create/merge node functions are no longer available outside of tests. Keeping them on the tests since sometimes I want to be able to easily override some default items (like the nextUpdate) during test node creation. 

## 0.1.0

First public release.
